# TreySimulator3
Trey simulator is a fun school club project that uses the BullyEngine. This allows the game to be mostly written in Lua and easy to help out with.
# How to Play TS3
To run TS3 first you must download the zip or clone this project. Downloading the zip is easier, but cloning the project will allow you to commit code.

Now you can either compile [BullyEngine][], or move the included executable to the root of the TS3 folder.
* for Windows copy the contents of \\TreySimulator3\\bullyEngine\\windows\\ to \\TreySimulator3\\
* for Linux copy the contents of /TreySimulator3/bullyEngine/Linux/ to /TreySimulator3/
* for Mac compile BullyEngine as soon as DanielBatteryStapler decides to upload the source

If you are using windows all you must do now is run the BullyEngine executable.

Dependencies for Linux, OSX, and others are not included. Once you install the following you can run the BullyEngine executable.
* libsdl2
* libsdl2-image
* liblua5.3

# Help make TS3
To help out I would first recommend learning the basics of [Lua][]. It is a very simple language and a good introduction to programming as a whole. This is because Lua has near English syntax.

Reading the [BullyEngine][] documentation will be very helpful when it is written and available.
