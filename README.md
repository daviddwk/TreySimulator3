# TreySimulator3
Trey simulator is a fun school club project that uses the BullyEngine. This allows the game to be mostly written in Lua and easy to help out with.
# How to Play TS3
To run TS3 first you must download the zip or clone this project. Downloading the zip is easier but cloning the project will allow you to commit code.

Now you must move the BullyEngine executable to the root of the TS3 folder
* for Windows copy the contents of \\TreySimulator3\\bullyEngine\\windows to \\TreySimulator3
* for Linux copy the contents of /TreySimulator3/bullyEngine/Linux to /TreySimulator3
* for Mac compile BullyEngine as soon as DanielBatteryStapler decides to upload the source

Finally, if you are using windows all you must do is run the BullyEngine executable.

Dependencies required for Linux and others include
* libsdl2
* libsdl2-image
* liblua5.3

# How to help make TS3
To help out I would first recommend learning the basics of [Lua][]. It is a very simple language and a good introduction to programming as a whole. This is because Lua has near English syntax.

Reading the BullyEngine documentation will be very helpful when it is written and available.
